# TodoList
 Another todo list app

 create a todo  list app whereby one enters a task he or she wants to to at a later time and adds it to the app

 how does one add the task item ? by clicking an add button after writing down the task which will dynamically add the task item to the page

 what data do we need in order to accomplish this ?
 user input data containing the list item data entered
 the data containing the button tag which will be clicked when adding the task item to the page
 the html elements which will make up our new  added task item 


Task 1: Create a way for a user to input a Task item on the webpage.

user clicks on input displaying prompt placeholder prompt 'Enter Task...';
user inputs information then presses side button to add new Task to the webpage for futre refferal

what do we need

structure the input display area and button with html and css


Task 2: Dynamically display a Task item on the webpage after user has created one.

the new Task is displayed on the webpage in its own display window with two buttons on the side.
the first button will have a checkmark icon where a user can click to check that the task is complete.
the second button will have a bin icom where a user can delete that particular task item.

Task 3: clear the entered Task from the input display window
when user has entered their Task information and have clicked add button, the prompt window must be clearered of the task information.


Task 4; add check, functionality to each Task item created.

the user must be able to check a Task item as completed by pressing the check mark button. 
when the button is clicked the Task written down is crossed with a line, indicating that it has been completed
this click action and resultant cross line must be specifc to the Task that user wants to mark as completed.
how do i add this specificty to the task in question ?
user, (action) clicks , specific task, task is linked to the behaviour (function) of crossing text information  with a line to indicate  task  is checked (completed) or uncheck task as incomplete if a certaion conditions are true

outcome we want to see - a line appears on the webpage crossing out the task.



Task 5, add delete functionality to each Task item created

user must be able to delete a task item added to the webpage
user action-clicks on the bin icon of the task they want to delete, the action of clicking is linked to a behaviour (function) which is has the delete functionality.
the outcome we want - the task is removed form the webpage 

the user must be able to delete a Task item by pressing the delete button.
