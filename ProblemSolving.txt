 Key Steps for Problem Solving summary

1. Define your problem
2. Make sure you fully understand the problem
3. Break the problem down into small and manageable pieces 
4. Go as deep as you can, until you can get to easy (yes or no) questions
5. Work your way from the bottom until the problem is solved
6. Recognise some problems are completely out of your control and that's ok.

Solving a problem effectively involves a structured approach. Here’s a breakdown of how one can solve problems:

1. Understand the Problem
Identify the Problem: Be specific about what the issue is. What is broken? What isn’t working as expected? Why is it a problem?
Gather Information: Learn everything you can about the problem. What are its causes? How does it affect the system or task? What resources are involved?
Define the Goal: What does the desired outcome look like? What does a "solved" version of the problem entail?

2. Break the Problem into Parts
Complex problems are easier to tackle when broken down into smaller, manageable chunks. By isolating each part, it’s easier to work on individual aspects and build a path toward the solution.

3. Research Solutions
Look for existing solutions or best practices in similar scenarios. Is there a known method to solve this type of problem? Do experts suggest specific tools or approaches?
Try to understand the problem from different angles or perspectives.

4. Brainstorm Possible Solutions
Generate multiple ideas for solving the problem. Don’t limit yourself—consider creative, out-of-the-box solutions as well as more conventional approaches.

5. Evaluate and Select the Best Solution
Weigh each potential solution's pros and cons. Consider factors like:
Feasibility: Can this be done with available resources?
Time: How long will this take to implement?
Impact: Will this solve the problem completely or only partially?

6. Plan and Implement the Solution
Develop a step-by-step plan to implement the solution. Organize your resources and prioritize actions.
Execute the plan systematically, ensuring each step contributes toward solving the issue.

7. Test and Measure the Solution
After implementing the solution, test whether it worked. Does the problem still exist? If not, did the solution meet the expected outcome?
Gather feedback from stakeholders or users if applicable.

8. Refine or Iterate if Necessary
If the problem isn’t fully resolved, revisit earlier steps. Analyze why it didn’t work, tweak your approach, or even consider alternative solutions.

9. Document the Process and Learn from It
Write down what worked, what didn’t, and the reasoning behind each decision. This helps in future problem-solving situations by building a reference of lessons learned.
Summary:

Solving a problem means clearly understanding it, breaking it down, exploring multiple solutions, selecting the best one, implementing it, and learning from the process for continuous improvement. It’s a cycle of observation, action, and adjustment.
